Remote login to running containers via SSH\r\n2. No need to run sshd in container\r\n3. Centralized and flexible user and permission management\r\n4. Web based user and container management\r\n\r\n# Install\r\nTo use docker bastion you should install docker (>=1.3.0) first.\r\nCheck https://docs.docker.com/v1.3/installation/ for docker installation guide.\r\n\r\nWhen docker is ready, run the following commands to build docker-bastion.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/gophergala/docker-bastion.git\r\ncd docker-bastion\r\n./build.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\nYou can run ```docker-bastion -h``` for help information.\r\n\r\n```\r\nNAME:\r\n   docker-bastion - Allow remote accessing docker containers via SSH\r\n\r\nUSAGE:\r\n   docker-bastion [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]\r\n\r\nVERSION:\r\n   0.1.0\r\n\r\nAUTHOR:\r\n  Shijiang Wei - <mountkin@gmail.com>\r\n\r\nCOMMANDS:\r\n   help, h  Shows a list of commands or help for one command\r\n   \r\nGLOBAL OPTIONS:\r\n   --ssh-addr ':2222'   the address that SSH listens\r\n   --manage-addr ':1015'  the address that the management listens\r\n   --help, -h     show help\r\n   --version, -v    print the version\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen docker-bastion is started, open your browser and visit the\r\n```--manage-addr``` you specified or the default 1015 port of the server.\r\n\r\nYou can create a user and assign some containers to the user, then the\r\nuser can login to the container via\r\n```ssh username.container-id@your-ip -p 2222``` (remeber to change 2222\r\nto your ```--ssh-addr```).\r\n\r\n# Screenshot\r\n\r\n![Container list](https://github.com/gophergala/docker-bastion/raw/master/screenshots/containers.png)\r\n\r\n![Users](https://github.com/gophergala/docker-bastion/raw/master/screenshots/users.png)\r\n\r\n# Roadmap\r\n1. [ ] replace ```docker exec``` with docker remote API, thus we can manage containers on other hosts.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
